    "Until recently, my whole professional life was connected with medicine - I graduated from medical university and slowly but steadily achieved my goal to become a surgeon. Afterwards, on the basis of the practical experience gained in the operating room, I acquired a PhD degree, in order to share my experience with students, while continuing being a surgeon.",
    "About 2 years ago my family encouraged me to try web developments as a tool to take a break from a daily (and mentally challenging) medicine routine. To my surprise, web development quickly became my obsession. Using open sources, I picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, Git as well as other techniques required to become a competent  Frontend developer. In order to deepen my knowledge, study at IT-incubator.io was also completed.",
    "After all this time spent learning new skills, I finally realized that web development is not just my hobby, it's the field where I want (and most importantly, can) work. I'd like to show you what I've achieved so far."
